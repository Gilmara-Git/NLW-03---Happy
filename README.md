## Extra Mile:
- Besides of the orginal project, I added a page with a list of the foster homes registered in the Database. Created a **Edit** button that directs users to another page that I also created to edit/delete resources.

- Reduced 4 lines of code to one line of code by using **conditional ternary operator** : orphanage.open_on_weekends = orphanage.open_on_weekends =="1" ? true : false



- On the CREATION page form applied a validation to determine if user has marked a point on the MAP indicating the foster home location, so, if user did not clicked on the map, he will prompted to do so.

## Features that needs improvement:
- When clicking on Buttons "Save" and "Delete" on page (edit-orphanage), it is throwing an Database issue.
